A tiny Django app to do stand-alone email confirmation with no users,
no dependencies, just an object that has an email address.

1. Stick emailconfirmation in your INSTALLED_APPS.

2. Add (r'^', include('emailconfirmation.urls')) to your urls.py.

3. Set EmailConfirmation.after_confirm and
   EmailConfirmation.after_unsubscribe to the name of urls.py entries that
   we will redirect to after successful confirmation and unsubscription.
   These should have a (\d+) somewhere in the URL where the ID of the
   confirmed object will go.

3. Anywhere you want an object that has an email field to be confirmed via
   email, make that object a subclass of emailconfirmation.models.EmailConfirmation.
   When you want to send the confirmation email, say just after the object has been
   created, call the confirm() method.

   Override emailconfirmation/email.txt to supply your own confirmation email, 
   or pass a Template or template path into confirm().
