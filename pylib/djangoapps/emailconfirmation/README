A tiny Django app to do stand-alone email confirmation with no users,
no dependencies, just an object that has an email address.

1. Stick emailconfirmation in your INSTALLED_APPS.

2. Add (r'^', include('emailconfirmation.urls')) to your urls.py.

3. Anywhere you want an object that has an email field to be confirmed via
   email, say just after it's been created, simply call:
       EmailConfirmation.objects.confirm(request, object, after_confirm, after_unsubscribe)
   and return a "Please check your email" page.
   'after_confirm' should be the name of a urls.py entry that we will redirect
   to after successful confirmation, and should have (\d+) somewhere in the URL
   where the ID of the confirmed object will go. 'after_unsubscribe' is
   similarly the name of a urls.py entry to redirect to after unsubscribing.

Override emailconfirmation/email.txt to supply your own confirmation email, or
pass a Template or template path into confirm().
'object' will refer to the object being confirmed.
